# Migration from v5

Some internal APIs have been removed due to changes in Vite's implementation. If you were relying on one of them, please create a [feature request](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%3A+pending+triage&projects=&template=feature_request.yml).

## Migration from v4
